    <p>After two great years working at nuom, a consultancy working with health and wellbeing startups, I moved to Lantum.</p>
<p>Lantum's mission is to radically transform healthcare by fixing the way healthcare professinals and their organisations work together. Essentially we are trying to solve the huge problems that exist around staffing and managaing the 4th biggest workforce in the world, the NHS. This resonates with me massively as my wife is a nurse working in the NHS and I see the effect lack of work-life balance, unsupported management, and reduced quality of life have on a person.</p>
<p>When I joined Lantum had just raised a Series A. The main focus of this raise was to move into new markets, in particular hospitals in England and Wales (previous we'd been focused on clinics and GP surgeries) and the US. I was the first design lead hire and only non-contractor.</p>
<p>Going in as a design lead in a startup that's going through their growth stage can be odd. You're in this middle ground between having to build and manage a team to scale design effectively across the organisation but also having a very hands-on approach. You're straddled between a Senior IC and a manager. For me, this is where I love to sit. The 'player coach' role allows me to fulfill my need for variety and challenge that I want from every job I have. However stressful it may be.</p>
