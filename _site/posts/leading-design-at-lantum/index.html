    <p>After two great years working at nuom, a consultancy working with health and wellbeing startups, I moved to Lantum.</p>
<p>Lantum's mission is to radically transform healthcare by fixing the way healthcare professinals and their organisations work together. Essentially we are trying to solve the huge problems that exist around staffing and managaing the 4th biggest workforce in the world, the NHS. This resonates with me massively as my wife is a nurse working in the NHS and I see the effect lack of work-life balance, unsupported management, and reduced quality of life have on a person.</p>
<p>When I joined Lantum had just raised a Series A. The main focus of this raise was to move into new markets, in particular hospitals in England and Wales (previous we'd been focused on clinics and GP surgeries) and the US. I was the first design lead hire and only non-contractor.</p>
<p>Going in as a design lead in a startup that's going through their growth stage can be odd. You're in this middle ground between having to build and manage a team to scale design effectively across the organisation but also having a very hands-on approach. You're straddled between a Senior IC and a manager. For me, this is where I love to sit. The 'player coach' role allows me to fulfill my need for variety and challenge that I want from every job I have. However stressful it may be.</p>
<p>This was the first full-time role I've had at a company that is beyond the early seed stage. My background has primarily been small businesses and seed-stage startups with a company of big boys thrown in here and there. I honestly didn't know what to expect. Based on a $12mil raise, I naively thought I'd have a lot of time and money to play with.</p>
<h2>Design at Lantum</h2>
<p>The first thing I asked in my interviews for Lantum was 'Why do you need a Head of Design?'. It might seem like an odd thing to ask in a job interview, but I've found that design means different things to different people. It's important for me to know what the company expects of my role, rather than me force what I think design should be to Lantum from the get go.</p>
<p>I was told by the then-CPO, that as their moving into new markets they wanted to make sure that a) The target customers worked in a complex structure and had complex needs that we couldnt guess our way to finding out, b) they had a good understanding of what products would resonate, as they've tried to port over what worked with Primary Care (GP surgeies and clinics) and a lot of it didn't work and c) that good UX was a gap that the main competitors couldn't fill.</p>
<p>After that, I was clear to me that there were a few things that we needed to do in the first year:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build a high-performing team of designers and researchers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Create a design culture based on learning and evaluation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Raise the bar of quality across our products</strong></li>
</ul>
