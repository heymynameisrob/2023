## Section title

Most of my career I’ve worked for startups or small agencies. I wanted to take the leap to a bigger company, so decided to go work at a large retail brand for 2 or 3years. It was hugely eye opening for me. It’s when I realised that the role and impact of design can differ depending on the size of your org. I quickly realised that startup life suited my personality, so jumped back to where I was.

Startups and startup culture gets a lot of press. But, a lot of the design conversation is lead by folks at larger companies. These companies may call themselves “startups” but their resources, headcount and user base see them closer to a huge multi-national rather than 5 people in a basement. Furthermore, the guides on how these two roles differ and the change in focus you need to move from one to the other is hardly documented.
